## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Task : you should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each   variable for each activity and each subject.

## Repository files

* CodeBook.md, which contains description of the variables in the table
* README.md, which contains instructions to run the script
* CourseProject.R, which contains source code
* tideData.txt, which is the result table
* UCI HAR Dataset folder, which contains all the data used in the project

## Instructions

* Clone this repository to new directory
* Change your working directory to this new directory
* Open R command line
* Start using $source("run_analysis.R")
